       "    <div class=\"mb-3\">In the summer of 2019, my mom received the daunting diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 52. The impact was profound, as my mom had been the pillar of strength in both our immediate and extended families. For about two years, my family and I shouldered the weight of her care, a collective effort that became even more challenging as her condition progressed. The onset of COVID brought the gift of remote work, allowing us to manage her needs more flexibly. As we inevitably had to return to our jobs and the demands of my mom's care intensified, we welcomed Chrissy into our lives. A friend of my parents from high school, Chrissy seamlessly transitioned into the role of a full-time caretaker and a new member of our family. Despite juggling rigorous marathon training, a full-time job and attempting to maintain a normal social life, I still make a deliberate effort to visit my parents a couple days every week. I find solace in being there for my mom and alleviating the burden on my dad, particularly during Chrissy's off-hours. The journey is challenging, but in the midst of it all I strive to find a delicate balance and treasure the fleeting moments with my mom. Even though my mom is not aware of the fact that I’m competing at the Trials, she always has (and always will be) my biggest supporter, not only in running, but also in life. I love you, mom -  This one's for you!</div>\n",

I met Carey in the summer of 2020, shortly after moving to Philly and seeking a way to make friends. Inspired by Carey's pursuit of ambitious running goals, I rekindled my passion for serious training and competition after a two-year hiatus. As our friendship deepened, Carey and I identified a gap for young professionals like us to join a tight-knit team supporting their running aspirations. Thus, Liberty Track Club was born, now boasting 25 members and sponsorship from Free People Movement and UCAN.</div>\n",

The impact was profound, as my mom had been the pillar of strength in both our immediate and extended families. For about two years, my family and I shouldered the weight of her care, a collective effort that became even more challenging as her condition progressed. The onset of COVID brought the gift of remote work, allowing us to manage her needs more flexibly. As we inevitably had to return to our jobs and the demands of my mom's care intensified, we welcomed Chrissy into our lives.

Despite juggling rigorous marathon training, a full-time job and attempting to maintain a normal social life, I still make a deliberate effort to visit my parents a couple days every week. I find solace in being there for my mom and alleviating the burden on my dad, particularly during Chrissy's off-hours. The journey is challenging, but in the midst of it all I strive to find a delicate balance and treasure the fleeting moments with my mom.

Since then, running has become a family passion, with my dad, brother and sister all completing marathons – my dad even clocked an impressive time of 2:52 at the age of 53!\\n\\nBeyond my family, I have a wonderful boyfriend, Kevin. A Villanova cross country and track alum, he and I have bonded over our shared passion for the sport.
